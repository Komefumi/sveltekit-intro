# Sveltekit Intro

Here is a simple introductory Sveltekit app, making use of TypeScript and TailwindCSS. This was made following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YipaPr4Aex8) by [James Q Quick](https://www.youtube.com/@JamesQQuick) and includes my own changes where deemed.

You're free to use this code as seen fit.
