I've made use of Github actions. I did not properly understand the mechanism of it at the time of this deployment, but it helped me become a bit more accustomed to it. Previously I used it to deploy my blog built with Astro, which you can find at [this repository](https://github.com/Komefumi/komefumi.github.io)

## Quick Description

Here is a simple introductory Sveltekit app, making use of TypeScript and TailwindCSS. This was made following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YipaPr4Aex8) by [James Q Quick](https://www.youtube.com/@JamesQQuick) and includes my own changes where deemed.

You're free to use this code as seen fit.
